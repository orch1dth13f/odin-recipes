            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra-extra-large anthropomorphic egg</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pre-heat pan on medium, until water sizzles when flicked into it - ideally alongside the nearest brick wall.</li>
                    <li>Add butter to the pan, letting it melt, and keeping an eye out for where any ovoid shadows are being cast from atop the aforementioned wall.</li>
                    <li>Steady the pan in the wall's unusual shadow, and aim any falling egg for the edge of the pan, allowing gravity to do the work of cracking it open.</li>
                    <li>Murmur the lord's prayer, and do three Hail Marys in tribute to the fallen egg, who fell quite a distance. Remove egg from the pan when edges are brown and the translucency has turned to white.</li>
                    <li>Salt egg and eat, avoiding eye contact with any king's horses or king's men who happen to be passing by.</li>
                    <li>Ta-da, I guess.</li>
                </ol>
        </div>
